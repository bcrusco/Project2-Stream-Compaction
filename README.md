CUDA Stream Compaction
======================

**University of Pennsylvania, CIS 565: GPU Programming and Architecture, Project 2**

* Bradley Crusco
* Tested on: Windows 10, i7-3770K @ 3.50GHz 16GB, 2 x GTX 980 4096MB (Personal Computer)

## Write-up

1. Update all of the TODOs at the top of this README.
2. Add a description of this project including a list of its features.
3. Add your performance analysis (see below).

All extra credit features must be documented in your README, explaining its
value (with performance comparison, if applicable!) and showing an example how
it works. For radix sort, show how it is called and an example of its output.

Always profile with Release mode builds and run without debugging.

### Questions

* Roughly optimize the block sizes of each of your implementations for minimal
  run time on your GPU.
  * (You shouldn't compare unoptimized implementations to each other!)

* Compare all of these GPU Scan implementations (Naive, Work-Efficient, and
  Thrust) to the serial CPU version of Scan. Plot a graph of the comparison
  (with array size on the independent axis).
  * You should use CUDA events for timing. Be sure **not** to include any
    explicit memory operations in your performance measurements, for
    comparability.
  * To guess at what might be happening inside the Thrust implementation, take
    a look at the Nsight timeline for its execution.

* Write a brief explanation of the phenomena you see here.
  * Can you find the performance bottlenecks? Is it memory I/O? Computation? Is
    it different for each implementation?

* Paste the output of the test program into a triple-backtick block in your
  README.
  * If you add your own tests (e.g. for radix sort or to test additional corner
    cases), be sure to mention it explicitly.

These questions should help guide you in performance analysis on future
assignments, as well.

## Submit

If you have modified any of the `CMakeLists.txt` files at all (aside from the
list of `SOURCE_FILES`), you must test that your project can build in Moore
100B/C. Beware of any build issues discussed on the Google Group.

1. Open a GitHub pull request so that we can see that you have finished.
   The title should be "Submission: YOUR NAME".
2. Send an email to the TA (gmail: kainino1+cis565@) with:
   * **Subject**: in the form of `[CIS565] Project 2: PENNKEY`
   * Direct link to your pull request on GitHub
   * In the form of a grade (0-100+) with comments, evaluate your own
     performance on the project.
   * Feedback on the project itself, if any.
